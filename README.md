Miscellaneous Projects

Here lie some side projects I've been working on. If you can make use of them, enjoy. Currently, there are two tile-based games - Conway's Game of Life, and Snake. Both were implemented in my rudimentary self-taught c.

note: Both games require SDL2 to run. You can download SDL2 at [the sdl website](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php)
